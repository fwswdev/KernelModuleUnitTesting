# KernelModuleUnitTesting

I took the kernel sample module code from https://blog.sourcerer.io/writing-a-simple-linux-kernel-module-d9dc3762c234

However, there are no unit tests. I included simple asserts to demonstrate how to do simple unit testing on a simple Kernel module.

I was able to unit test/debug this simple kernel module using Eclipse Oxygen with gdb.

I will be create another version but using a proper Unit Test Framework.
